                          Aapl C++ Template Library
                          =========================

Requirements
============
 * Modern C++ compiler

Install
=======

There is no install yet. To use aapl in your project simply drop
the Aapl source directory into your project. Though the code is very
stable, the interfaces (function names, semantics of calls) are not. I am
constantly in search of a more generic and easy to understand interface.
Install Aapl if you like, but I would recommend waiting for the interface
to become more mature.
