                     Ragel State Machine Compiler
                     ============================

DEPENDENCIES
============

Ragel depends on the Colm Programming Language. For now, the two packages move
in close lockstep. If building master of ragel, generally, the master branch of
colm is required. For releases, the specific version of colm needed is in
EXPECTED_COLM_VER in configure.ac.

BUILDING
========

Ragel is built with autotools. If building from revision control you need to
run autogen.sh. Then you can configure and make.

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-colm=$COLM_INSTALL_PATH
$ make

There are three dockerfiles that demonstrate installing dependencies and
building:

* full.Dockerfile installs all dependencies, including testing dependencies,
  builds master, and does full testing.

* master.Dockerfile does a basic build from master without testing.

* release.Dockerfile builds and installs the release tarballs.
