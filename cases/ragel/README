The test suite depends on Colm. Tests are now being written in a fictional
mini-language designed for the purpose of testing ragel. The host language
test-cases are then generated using a Colm Program. This allows one test case
to be run against all host languages in addition to all code generation styles.

It is possible to soft-link to external test directories. The external
directory should have a 'runtests' program.
