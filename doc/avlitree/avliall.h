/** 
 * \defgroup avlitree Linked AVL Tree
 * \brief Linked balanced binary tree.
 * 
 * These data structures are identical to the AVL tree data structure except
 * elements are implicitly linked together in an ordered list. This does not
 * add more than a constant amount of work to each operation and allows the
 * use of next and previous pointers for walking the items in the tree.
