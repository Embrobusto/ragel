/**
 * \mainpage Aapl C++ Template Library
 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * Aapl is a C++ template library. It provides much of the functionality found
 * in the STL, but aims to more versatile than typical template libraries.
 * There are many different 'flavours' of the data structures allowing the
 * programmer to have it their own way. Aapl data structures do not have
 * private data members.
 *
 * Aapl does not conform to any known standards. It is a custom job designed
 * solely to meet the tastes of the author.
