 * \mainpage Aapl C++ Template Library
 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * Aapl is a C++ template library for generic programming. It contains
 * implementations of %AVL Tree, Linked List, %Vector, Binary Search %Table,
 * Queue, %String and %Sort.
 *
 * Aapl supports different generic programming paradigms by providing
 * variations of standard data structures. For example, a by-value linked list
 * template may be used to store a user supplied type such as an integer. A
 * different list template allows the user to define the data structure that
 * is to be used as the element. A third list template allows a single
 * instance of a data structure to be an element in multiple lists.
 *
 * Wherever possible, Aapl data structures do not depend on heap memory
 * allocation. There are variations of the linked list and AVL tree that allow
 * the programmer to allocate a collection of elements statically and
 * insert/remove them at will.
 *
 * Aapl data structures do not have data members that are hidden behind a
 * strict abstraction layer. Aapl makes very little use of the private
 * keyword.  Though data abstractions can be a useful programming technique to
 * quickly produce very robust code, they can inhibit functionality when the
 * data structure is the centre of much attention. Therefore Aapl leaves the
 * use of abstractions up to the programmer.
