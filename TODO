                               ====

-Docs for all code with Doxygen (ooh baby, gotta love that doxygen).
-Finish Editor Buffer
-More Iterators
-More Lowercasing the interface.
-Singly linked list.
-Xor list
-The union of two sets can be done in O(N) time, instead of O(N*log(N)); Perhaps
 decide which is cheaper on the fly and then do that.
-String class based on VectSimp<char> (why, for the fun of it).
-Ref-counted implicity shared versions of all classes.
-Copy-on-write automatically shared versions of all classes.
-Generic automatic pointers that can be used to make automatic pointers for any class.
